# ToDo-List
A full-stack TODO-List application coded using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) is a web application that allows users to create, manage, and track tasks or to-do items

## Functionality:

Create Task: Users can input task details in the task form and add new tasks to the list.

Read Task: The application retrieves and displays tasks from the MongoDB database, showing their titles, descriptions, due dates, and completion status.

Update Task: Users can edit task details such as title, description, and due date. They can also toggle the status of a task between completed and uncompleted.

Delete Task: Tasks can be removed from the list when users decide to delete them.

Filter and Sort: Users can filter tasks based on completion status or due date, and sort them in ascending or descending order.
